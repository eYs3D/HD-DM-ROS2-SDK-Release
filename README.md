----------

## Support platforms

* Support x86_64 (64-bit)
* Tested on X86 PC with Ubuntu 20.04  
* These are the currently supported ROS2 Distributions:   
  - Foxy Fitzroy (Ubuntu 20.04 Focal)

## Installation ROS2 FOXY Instructions

The following instructions are written for ROS Foxy on Ubuntu 20.04

 - Set locale  
   Make sure you have a locale which supports UTF-8.  

    ```
    locale  # check for UTF-8  
    
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales  
    sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8  
    sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8  
    export LANG=en_US.UTF-8  
    
    locale  # verify settings
    ```   
  - Setup Sources  
    You will need to add the ROS 2 apt repositories to your system. To do so, first authorize our GPG key with apt like this: 
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release   
    sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key  -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg   
    ```   
    And then add the repository to your sources list:  
    ``` 
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
    ```   
  - Install ROS 2 packages  
    Update your apt repository caches after setting up the repositories.  
    ```   
    sudo apt update  
    ```   
    Desktop Install (Recommended): ROS, RViz, demos, tutorials.
    ```     
    sudo apt install ros-foxy-desktop  
    ```   
  - Environment setup  
    Set up your environment by sourcing the following file.  
    ```  
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash  
    ```   
    Add sourcing to your shell startup script.  
    ```  
    echo "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc  
    ```   
  - Check environment variables  
    Sourcing ROS 2 setup files will set several environment variables necessary for operating ROS 2.   
    If you ever have problems finding or using your ROS 2 packages, make sure that your environment is properly setup using the following command:  
    ```   
    printenv | grep -i ROS  
    ```  
    Check that variables like ROS_DISTRO and ROS_VERSION are set. For example, if you’re using Foxy, you would see:  
    ```   
    ROS_VERSION=2
    ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3
    ROS_DISTRO=foxy
    ```  
  - Try some examples  
    If you installed ros-foxy-desktop above you can try some examples.  
    In one terminal, source the setup file and then run a C++ talker:  
    ```  
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
    ```  
    In another terminal source the setup file and then run a Python listener:  
    ```  
    source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
    ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
    ```  
    You should see the talker saying that it’s Publishing messages and the listener saying I heard those messages.  
    This verifies both the C++ and Python APIs are working properly. Hooray!

## Build eYs3D ROS2    
 - Installing and initializing rosdep  
   ```  
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y python3-rosdep
   sudo rosdep init
   rosdep update
   ```  
 - Installing colcon tool  
   ```
   sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions  
   ```  
 - Resolve dependencies  
   Before building the workspace, you need to resolve package dependencies. You may have all the dependencies already, 
   but best practice is to check for dependencies every time you clone. You wouldn’t want a build to fail after a long wait because of missing dependencies.

   From the root of your workspace (dev_ws), run the following command:
   ```
   rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro foxy -y
   ``` 
   If you already have all your dependencies, the console will return:  
   ```
   #All required rosdeps installed successfully  
   ``` 
 - Build the workspace with colcon  
   From the root of your workspace (dev_ws), you can now build your packages using the command:
   ```
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ``` 
   The console will return the following message:  
   ```
   Starting >>> dm_preview
   Finished <<< dm_preview [6.17s]

   Summary: 1 package finished [6.28s]
   ``` 
   Once the build is finished, enter ls in the workspace root (~/dev_ws) and you will see that colcon has created new directories:
   ```
   build  install  log  src
   ``` 
   The install directory is where your workspace’s setup files are, which you can use to source your overlay.
----------

## Usage Instructions
Start the eYs3D depth camera node, this will stream all camera sensors and publish on the appropriate ROS topics.  
From the root of your workspace (dev_ws), run the following command:  
- **using the launch file**  
   ```
   . install/setup.bash
   ros2 launch dm_preview apc_camera_launch.py
   ``` 
   ![ros2_preview_rviz2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88474678/134872905-16ae6186-12c5-469f-8aa9-1f8f36122bc0.png)

- **without using the launch file**  
   ```
   . install/setup.bash
   ros2 run dm_preview apc_camera_node
   ```   
   In another terminal source the setup file and then run a C++ listener:
   ```  
   . install/setup.bash
   ros2 run dm_preview apc_camera_listener_node
   ``` 
   ![listener_node](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88474678/136147902-33a8b8b1-0c5d-4997-aaa4-ddf5c8e04977.png)
